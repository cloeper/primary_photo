-Homepage:
    - [DONE] "How it works" should be changed to "Let's get Started" and the text below it should be removed and replaced with 2 links that read "to book a one-on-one seminar, click here" and "to learn more about our memberships, click here" with links to those pages.

    - [DONE] The text under "learn from the best" should be replaced with "We are a team of professional photographers and educators dedicated to teaching you everything about photography, videography, lighting, sound, editing, and more! We offer one-on-one classes with flexible locations and times to meet even the toughest of schedules. When paired with our intensive group workshops and multi-benefit membership program, there's nothing we can't help you accomplish." the link below the text to the bios page should remain.

    - [DONE] The info below the pricing on the homepage should just be the three bullet points:
        - 2 hour one-on-one seminar = $149.00 (30% off for members)
        - Workshops (ranging by subject) = $75 to $500 (30% off for members)
        - Memberships = $15/month
    -leave the "more" link to the pricing page, but instead of the link that reads "group seminar classes coming soon" could your replace it with "learn more about our up and coming workshops here, with a link to the indiegogo page.

-Memberships tab:
    - [DONE] If possible, the "Terms and Conditions" needs to be changed to a required field checkbox above the proceed to payment button. Also when you click on the terms and conditions link the format is all wonky.
    - [DONE] could you add a non-required field labeled "Company Name" after the "Last Name" field.

-Booking tab:
    - [DONE] The terms and conditions for the one-on-ones, workshops and gifts need to be added here as a required field checkbox like on the membership tab. these terms and conditions are different from the ones on the membership page and are attached to that first email I sent you labeled "all the things."

-Workshop tab:
    - [DONE] Please delete all of the text below "Workshops" and replace it with "For more information about our up and coming workshops, visit our page at (indiegogo link) or contact us (link to contact page).

-All Pages:
    - [DONE] In the banner, can you drop the links to Facebook, twitter, email, book appointment and phone number down about 1.5" below the company name, I think it would make them easier to see against the new banner photo.
