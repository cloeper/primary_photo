                        <p>
                            A: Absolutely! Just click the Sign Up button from the homepage. You will be asked if you are purchasing this seminar for yourself or as a gift.  Select “gift” and answer the questions that follow.  At the end you will be given a certificate with a code and the students name.

                        <p>
                            A: You have one year from the day that the one-on-one seminar was purchased for you to select a date for you seminar.  For example, if your gift were purchased on January 1st 2013, you would have until January 1st 2014 to select a date for it. The expiration date is printed on your gift certificate for your convenience.

                            A: The one-on-one seminar availability calendar extends up to 30 days past the scheduling date.  So if you redeem your one-on-one seminar on January 1st, you will see all available dates up to February 1st to schedule. If no dates are available, please contact us so we can make other arrangements.

Just give your certificate or code to the new student. When they are ready to redeem the gift, they’ll just click on the Gift Redemption button on the homepage and follow the instructions as if they were you.

                            A: Yes, provided that the instructor you want is available.  When scheduling your seminar, you will be asked if you have an instructor preference.  If you do select their name from the dropdown list and then click “next.” The availability calendar will then only display the dates available for the instructor you have chosen. If no dates appear available then you can click “back” to change your preference. If you absolutely must have the instructor selected and no dates appear available, click the “contact me with available dates” button at the bottom of the calendar.

                            A: Typically one-on-one seminars cost $149.00/2 hours.  We do, however, frequently run discounts and coupons on websites like Groupon.com, LivingSocial.com, MercPerks.com, Tippr.com and Perks.com.  You can also find our paper coupons in many local camera stores and print shops. We also have been known to offer discounts to return customers and referred customers.

                        <p>
                            A: We know that some cameras and other pieces of photographic equipment and software are more complicated than others, that’s why we offer up to two hours for any questions you may have.  However, if we run out of basics to cover, and you run out of questions for us, your instructor will most likely start walking around with you near the instruction site to apply the lessons you just learned.  If you were studying software or lighting, then the instructor will come up with other suitable ways to fill the time and cement in the subject matter.  If, however, you for whatever reason wish to end the lesson early, you do have that option, but please know that no partial refunds will be issued under any circumstances.

                        <p>
                            A: The one-on-one seminars are designed to go over the basics of any camera (may it be for photo or video), software or peripheral photographic device such as flashes, light meters, intervelometers, Gigapans, Perspective Control lenses, etc. That being said, we will instruct you in the operation of your chosen subject mater and apply that operation to the scientific properties of photography.  We will not, however, spend the whole seminar discussing subjects like “what to do when your shooting a wedding” or “what are all the best settings for shooting a good close-up/macro picture.”  These are questions who’s answers may change drastically based on the circumstances your shooting in.  Which is why we are developing hands-on group workshops to go over subjects just like these in the appropriate environment and with all the recommended gear for you to play with.  See Workshops for more information.  If you’re not sure whether your subject is suitable for a one-on-one seminar please feel free to contact us.

                        <p>
                            A: Besides a love of photography? Well, yes.  Make sure that you bring all of the equipment you want to go over and all the peripheral pieces that may have come with it.  Make sure that all of your devices batteries are charged/fresh (if necessary). If you are going over software, bring a laptop with the software pre-loaded on it, a fully charged battery and backup power cable. Lastly, bring something for you to take notes with.  These seminars cover a MASSIVE amount of information; you will want a way to reference back to it later when you’re practicing what you learned.

                        <p>
                            A: When you choose to schedule a one-on-one seminar for yourself, you will be prompted to select a date from an availability calendar. The calendar will display all available dates from the day after the present, to thirty days after the present. For example, if you choose to sign up on January 1st, you can choose any available date from the calendar between January 2nd and February 1st.  Please note that if you select a specific instructor, your scheduling options will be limited to the days that instructor is available.  If you absolutely must have the instructor selected and no dates appear available, click the “contact me with available dates” button at the bottom of the calendar. We will call you to schedule a time when your proffered instructor is available.

                            A: You may reschedule your seminar if you contact us at least 48 hours before your original seminar date.

                            A: For liability reasons, we cannot send an instructor to the private home of any student, nor can the student come to an instructors residence. We instead will send the instructor to meet the student at any convenient public location within a ten-mile radius of the downtown Portland area. Some examples of suitable locations are coffee bars, public parks, business offices, restaurants etc. The instructor reserves the right to refuse any location if they see it as a risk to the student’s, or their own personal safety.  Any location refusals will be made known to the student in advance of the instruction date and with enough time for a new location to be selected.

                        <p>
                            A: Colleges, universities and trade schools don’t issue refunds for missed classes and neither do we.  You are responsible for showing up to your one-on-one seminar at the scheduled time and date with all the necessary materials.  If you miss your seminar, you will not be eligible for any refund, full or partial, nor will you have an opportunity to reschedule without signing up and paying for a new one-on-one seminar.

                            A: The cost of group workshops will be based on the amount of seats available and the costs associated with the subject matter. That being said, we expect them to range between $99-$299/seat with limited exceptions.
